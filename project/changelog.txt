	-- I added pretty bare webpages for the navigation tabs.
	-- I added some css formatting to the modules on some pages just to give a visual of what I was thinking. Feel free to change
		whatever you want.
	-- It might be more efficient to make the modules clickable. Once you click on them, you are taken to page dedicated to the
		content of that module.
	-- I also added a short bio in the Contact Us page because the Phase 3 outlines tell us to.
